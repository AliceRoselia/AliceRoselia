Game devs, if they be worthy, shall have the power of Notch.

######Hi, I'm Alice!
Nice to meet you! I have popcorn!
If I have to tell you one thing, it's my dream.
My dream reaches far, sadly not my ability, not yet, just... almost!

My planned projects
- Arceus.jl An entity component/management system based on magic bitboard.
- Nebula.jl A game engine built from the first principle with focus on world-building from its physics.
- Mavis.jl A genius search framework. Searches for path, chess move, and more! Searches and find the magic solution.

Let's have fun together!
