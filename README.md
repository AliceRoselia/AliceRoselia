# AliceRoselia (Tarny)
I was a puny one in a world doing all right,
then I became a genius overnight.
Never got to figure out how to do it right. 
So much to learn and see.

Up in my mind with new possibilities
And the fights that just are too crazy
A whole new chance, the world is waiting for me.
I'm so excited to be.

Tarny the great: I've got to know what being genius's all about. 
Tarny the great: It's in my way, I've got to adventure every day. 

Tarny. It's gonna be my time to show the world that I am Tarny the great.
